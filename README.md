#Requirements
* Implement a List constructor using a class with a length property.
* Implement push() mentod on the List prototype to add items to the list.  The push method will take one parameter.  No restrictions on the type of data in the parameter.
* Implement pop() method on the List prototype to remove the last item from the list and return the value.  The pop method does not take any parameters.
* Implement forEach(), map(), filter(), and reduce() as pure methods on the List prototype
* Do not use any built-in array methods to do this

#Testing
Use the `describe` and `it` (or `test`) methods to define descriptive tests and increase readablity
Each `it` callback should aim to test a small, well defined, feature of a function - this may include:
  * tests that ensure the list module functions correctly with error-check parameters
  * tests that the correct errors are thrown with invalid arguments exist
  * tests to ensure that the list module functions return the correct results when invoked with valid arguments

#Worked with and Credits
Nothing specific.
